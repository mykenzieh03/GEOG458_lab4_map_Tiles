Recreational Shellfish Beaches in Washington State: [https://mykenzieh03.github.io/GEOG458_lab4_map_tiles/map.html](https://mykenzieh03.github.io/GEOG458_lab4_map_Tiles/map.html)https://mykenzieh03.github.io/GEOG458_lab4_map_Tiles/map.html

This map shows the recreational shellfish beaches within Washington State. Along the coastline, there are mulitple areas where recreational shellfish activities can be done. Seeing this map makes me wonder the cross over between the environment and health, with this data we can see if there is sewage or waste waters going into and impacting these areas of recreational shellfish activities. Growing up my family and I spent time crabbing, fishing, and clamming. This also makes me wonder how often were waters are contaminated with polution and at what level is the parks alert recreational shellfish goers. 

Some struggles I had with this map was rendering the tiles, initially when I started the map I had about 16 million tiles to render then learned that I needed to zoom in and decrease my zoom when working with qmetatiles. My zoom levels were between 3 and 7, might account for the less appealing state of my map. I did try to mess around with different intervals, but it would end up rendering for a while. Setting my zoom levels to 3 and 7, allowed rendering to happen almost instanteously. 

The colors I chose were because they reminded me the beach and shellfish in general, though Washington beaches tend to be gloomy and grey. I think about the summer and various colors of sea creatures found in tide pools. Shellfish in Washington also follow that same grey scale color palette, so for the map to be more interesting I added more bright colors so the increase contrast.
